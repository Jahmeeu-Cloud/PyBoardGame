        <strong>Blackjack</strong>, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players
        and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other.
        It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.
        The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get 21 points in hand (called a "blackjack"), without a dealer blackjack;</li>
        <li>Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or</li>
        <li>Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.</li>
      </ul>

  <p>
    Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table at which you sit.
    The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Facecards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all
    worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of thecard values. Players are allowed to draw
    additional cards to improve their hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealerâ€™s turn. The dealer's hand don't have to be
    completed if all other players have busted. The dealer must reveal the hidden card and must hit until the cards
    total 17 or more points. Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and
    having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have
    the same total, the player lose. Otherwise, the dealer wins.
