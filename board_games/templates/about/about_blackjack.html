{% block about %}
  <div class="row">

      <p>
        <strong>Blackjack</strong>, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players
        and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other.
        It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.
        The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get 21 points in hand (called a "blackjack"), without a dealer blackjack;</li>
        <li>Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or</li>
        <li>Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table at which you sit.
    The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all
    worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to
    draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called "soft", meaning that the
    hand will not bust by taking an additional card; the value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from
    exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is "hard".
  </p>
  <p>
    Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer’s turn. The dealer's hand don't have to be
    completed if all other players have busted. The dealer must reveal the hidden card and must hit until the cards
    total 17 or more points. Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and
    having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have
    the same total, the player lose. Otherwise, the dealer wins.

<!-- Variant section -->
{% block variant %}
  <p>
    Here is a list of variants of the game of Blackjack:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Spanish 21</strong> provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number
      of cards (with the option to rescue, or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more
      card 21s, 6–7–8 21s, 7–7–7 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always
      winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed
      version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name "Pontoon"
      (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game "Pontoon" which has substantially different
      rules).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>21st-Century Blackjack</strong> (also known as "Vegas Style" Blackjack) is found in California card rooms.
      In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the
      player can still push if the dealer busts as well, although the dealer typically has to bust with a higher total.
      Double Exposure Blackjack deals the first two cards of the dealer's hand face up. Blackjacks pay even money, and
      players lose on ties; also, they can neither buy insurance nor can they surrender their hand (as both dealer's
      cards are exposed at the outset).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Double Attack Blackjack</strong> has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager
      after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blackjack Switch</strong> is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to
      interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10–6 and 5–10, then the player can switch two cards to make hands
      of 10–10 and 6–5. Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- Other info section -->
{% block other_info %}
  <p>
    Novels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these
    were The Blackjack Hijack (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie Nowhere to Run, and Bringing Down
    the House (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as 21. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film The Last
    Casino.
