      <p>
        <strong>2048</strong> is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele
        Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the
        number 2048. After reaching the 2048 tile, players can continue to play (beyond the 2048 tile). When the player
        has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        2048 is played on a gray 4 Ã— 4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the arrow
        keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
        Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge
        of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total
        value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.
