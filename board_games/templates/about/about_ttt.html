{% block about %}
  <p>
    <strong>Tic-tac-toe</strong> (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two
    players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 × 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of
    their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

{% block strategy %}
  <p>
    A player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least, draw) if each time it is his turn to play, he
    chooses the first available move from the following list, as used in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe
    program.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Win:</strong> If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Block:</strong> If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the
      opponent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fork:</strong> Create an opportunity where the player has two threats to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blocking an opponent's fork:</strong> If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player
      should block it. Otherwise, the player should block any forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to create
      two in a row. Otherwise, the player should create a two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as
      it doesn't result in them creating a fork. For example, if "X" has two opposite corners and "O" has the center,
      "O" must not play a corner in order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario creates a fork for "X" to win.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Center:</strong> A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner
      gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it
      makes no difference between perfect players.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Opposite corner:</strong> If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Empty corner:</strong> The player plays in a corner square.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Empty side:</strong> The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Though it seems that playing any square on the board for the first move has can always allow the player to force a
    win or draw, playing the corner gives the opponent the smallest choice of squares which must be played to avoid
    losing. This might suggest that the corner is the best opening move for X.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second player, who shall be designated "O", must respond to X's opening mark in such a way as to avoid the
    forced win. Player O must always respond to a corner opening with a center mark, and to a center opening with a
    corner mark.
  </p>
  <p>
    More detailedly, to guarantee a draw, O should adopt the following strategies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If X plays corner opening move, O should take center, and then an edge, forcing X to block in the next move. This
      will stop any forks from happening. When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start by marking a
      corner, O takes the center, and X takes the corner opposite the original. In that case, O is free to choose any
      edge as its second move. However, if X is not a perfect player and has played a corner and then an edge, O should
      not play the opposite edge as its second move, because then X is not forced to block in the next move and can
      fork.
    </li>
    <li>
      If X plays edge opening move, O should take center or one of the corners adjacent to X, and then follow the above
      list of priorities, mainly paying attention to block forks.
      If X plays center opening move, O should take corner, and then follow the above list of priorities, mainly paying
      attention to block forks. When X plays corner first, and O is not a perfect player, the following may happen:
    </li>
    <li>
      If O responds with a center mark (best move for them), a perfect X player will take the corner opposite the
      original. Then O should play an edge. However, if O plays a corner as its second move, a perfect X player will
      mark the remaining corner, blocking O's 3-in-a-row and making their own fork.
    </li>
    <li>
      If O responds with a corner mark, X is guaranteed to win, by simply taking any of the other two corners and then
      the last, a fork. (since when X takes the third corner, O can only take the position between the two X's. Then X
      can take the only remaining corner to win)
    </li>
    <li>
      If O responds with an edge mark, X is guaranteed to win, by taking center, then O can only take the corner
      opposite the corner which X plays first. Finally, X can take a corner to create a fork and then X will win on the
      next move.
    </li>
  </ul>

{% block history %}
  <p>
    Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found
    on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE.
  </p>
  <p>
    An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni
    lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having unlimited number of pieces, each player only had three, thus
    they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all
    over Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
    The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses", the British
    name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. The first print reference to a game called
    "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, "Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack" of the older version name. The US
    renaming of "noughts and crosses" as "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC
    computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games. The computer player
    could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The
    Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently
    on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.

  <h3 class="subheader">Variants</h3>
  <p>
    Many board games share the element of trying to be the first to get n-in-a-row, including Three Men's Morris, Nine
    Men's Morris, pente, gomoku, Qubic, Connect Four, Quarto, Gobblet, Order and Chaos, Toss Across, and Mojo.
    Tic-tac-toe is an instance of an m,n,k-game, where two players alternate taking turns on an m×n board until one of
    them gets k in a row. Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a list of some variants of Tic-Tac-Toe game:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>3-dimensional tic-tac-toe</strong> on a 3×3×3 board. In this game, the first player has an easy win by
      playing in the centre if 2 people are playing.
    </li>
    <li>
      In <strong>misère tic-tac-toe</strong>, the player wins if the opponent gets n in a row. A 3×3 game is a draw.
      More generally, the first player can draw or win on any board (of any dimension) whose side length is odd, by
      playing first in the central cell and then mirroring the opponent's moves.
    </li>
    <li>
      In <strong>"wild" tic-tac-toe</strong>, players can choose to place either X or O on each move.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Number Scrabble</strong> or <strong>Pick15</strong> is isomorphic to tic-tac-toe but on the surface
      appears completely different. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not
      be repeated. The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used
      and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 magic
      square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged in a
      straight line if and only if they total 15.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="subheader">Random Facts</h3>
  <p>
    Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good
    sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is
    straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially
    different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the
    game tree complexity) on this space.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game can be generalized to an m, n, k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on
    an m × n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3, 3, 3)-game.
    Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as a
    n<sup>d</sup> game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2. If played properly, the game will end
    in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.
