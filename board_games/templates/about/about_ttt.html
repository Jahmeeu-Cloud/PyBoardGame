<!-- About section -->
{% block about %}
  <p>
    <strong>Tic-tac-toe</strong> (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two
    players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 × 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of
    their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good
    sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is
    straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially
    different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the
    game tree complexity) on this space.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game can be generalized to an m, n, k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on
    an m × n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3, 3, 3)-game.
    Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as a
    n<sup>d</sup> game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2. If played properly, the game will end
    in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

<!-- History section -->
{% block history %}
  <p>
    Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found
    on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE.
  </p>
  <p>
    An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni
    lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they
    had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all
    over Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
    The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses", the British
    name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. The first print reference to a game called
    "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, "Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of
    backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of "noughts and crosses" as "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th
    century.

    In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC
    computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games. The computer player
    could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The
    Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently
    on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.
